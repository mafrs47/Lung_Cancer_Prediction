# Lung Cancer Prediction Project

Welcome to the "Lung Cancer Prediction" repository, where we utilize machine learning models such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM to predict lung cancer risks. This project focuses on analyzing patient data, including features such as age, smoking habits, and symptoms, to provide accurate predictions for early diagnosis. Our approach includes data preprocessing, visualization, and performance evaluation to ensure the reliability of the predictions.

## Project Overview

In this project, we leverage the power of artificial intelligence in healthcare to predict lung cancer risks. By employing various machine learning techniques, we aim to assist medical professionals in identifying potential cases of lung cancer at an early stage. The project focuses on data science concepts such as decision tree classifiers, feature engineering, and healthcare AI.

## Machine Learning Models

### Random Forest

Random Forest is a versatile machine learning algorithm that is effective in handling large datasets with multiple features. By constructing a multitude of decision trees during the training phase, Random Forest can provide robust predictions for complex problems like lung cancer risk assessment.

### Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks. In the context of lung cancer prediction, Logistic Regression analyzes the relationship between patient features and the likelihood of developing the disease. Its simplicity and interpretability make it a valuable tool in medical analysis.

### SVM (Support Vector Machine)

SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm that can handle both linear and non-linear classification tasks. By mapping data points into high-dimensional space, SVM aims to find the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes, making it suitable for tasks like lung cancer prediction based on diverse patient data.

## Key Features

- **Data Visualization:** We employ data visualization techniques to gain insights from patient data, helping us understand patterns and trends related to lung cancer risk factors.

- **Performance Evaluation:** Our project focuses on evaluating the performance of machine learning models to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the predictions. By using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, we assess the effectiveness of the models.

- **Feature Engineering:** Feature engineering plays a crucial role in extracting relevant information from the input data and improving the predictive power of the models. By selecting and transforming features, we enhance the performance of our lung cancer prediction system.
